# Battle Lines

This is a vb.net game build using native graphics. It is designed to handle player vs player or player vs computer. Each player select their team of nine heroes from different classes and ranks. You then deploy on the hex-board and take turns. Each turn, a player can select any hero to move, attack, and use one of three special abilities when they are not on cooldown. Some special abilities offer temporary buffs or debuffs.

The moves are shown on screen graphically, such as a fireball exploding, and are also described with text on the right.

Future plans for this include allowing players to play against each other over the internet. It could include things like diffent play mode options, like timed rounds and leaderboard competitions. If anyone feels like contributing by enhancing the graphics or working on asynchronous gameplay, collaboration is welcome.
